# Turbo_TCG_codes

This branch is to work for codes of PTCG crawler.

Progress: Code built. Simple test is done. 

Future work: A test based on Whole set of cards. (e.g. sv4a / SV5)

Also, complete Code improve below to improve code maintenance and code line reusability.  

After this future, Merge of Main branch is ready. 

Code improve:
    1. Add part to capture HTML block for card description.
    2. Using an array to store card information.
    3. Array can be used to print repeatly with while/for loop. 
    4. Array should based on those heading that Shopify input CSV needs. 

Problem not fixed: Cannot select Rarity of cards, as no Rarity information in HTML codes.
