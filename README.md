# Turbo_TCG_codes

This branch is to work for codes of PTCG crawler.

Progress: Code built. Simple test is done. 

Future work: A test based on Whole set of cards. (e.g. SV4a / SV5)
After this future, Merge of Main branch is ready. 

Code improve:
    1. Add part to capture HTML block for card description.
    2. Using CLASS card to store card information.
    3. CLASS card should based on those heading that Shopify input CSV needs. 

Problem not fixed: Cannot select Rarity of cards, as no Rarity information in HTML codes.
