# Turbo_TCG_codes

This branch is to work for codes of PTCG crawler.

Progress: Code built. Simple test is done. 

Future work: A test based on Whole set of cards. (e.g. SV4a / SV5)
After this future, Merge of Main branch is ready. 

Problem not fixed: Cannot select Rarity of cards, as no Rarity information in HTML codes.
